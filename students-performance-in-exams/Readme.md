# Students Performance Analysis using Desision Tree and Random Forest Classifier

__Introduction__
A __Decision Tree__ is a decision support tool that uses a tree-like graph or model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource cost, and utility. It is one way to display an algorithm that only contains conditional control statements.

They are adaptable at solving any kind of problem at hand (classification or regression). Decision Tree algorithms are referred to as __CART (Classification and Regression Trees)__.
