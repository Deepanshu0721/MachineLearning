__Price of House__  as a __function__ of __Area ,Airconditioning, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Stories, Mainroad, Guestroom, Basement, Hotwaterheating, Airconditioning, Parking, Prefarea and Furnishingstatus__. Suppose that in our role as __Data Scientist__ we are asked to suggest.

- We want to find a function that given input Price of House for Area, Bedroom, Bathroom and Airconditioning.

- Visualize the __relationship__ between the _features_ and the _response_ using scatter plots and line plot.

What are the **features**?

- Price            :   Price of House
- Area             :   Area of that particular House
- Bedroom          :   No. of Bedrooms in that House
- Stories          :   No. of Stories

After fitting simple multiple regression line, coefficients are as follows:

__area = 0.41 (X1)__

__bedrooms = 0.22 (X2)__

__stories = 0.30 (X3)__

__airconditioning = 0.46 (X4)__

__intercept = -1.35 (c)__
___
Final regression line is as follows: __Price = 0.41X1 + 0.22X2 + 0.30X3 + 0.46X4 - 1.35.__
