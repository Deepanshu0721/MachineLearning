__Introduction__

_Dimension Reduction using PCA:_

__Principal component analysis (PCA)__ is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables (entities each of which takes on various numerical values) into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components.

__When should I use PCA?__
* Do you want to reduce the number of variables, but arenâ€™t able to identify variables to completely remove from consideration?
* Do you want to ensure your variables are independent of one another?
* Are you comfortable making your independent variables less interpretable?
